I have temporarily granted access to the repository via drive letter R: on this system.
This is not optimal when multiple users can access the repo at the same time.
You should not go to R: or change any files their directly, use svn instead.
The current URL is file:///R:/svn/trunk



1:40 PM 9/26/2013 PROBLEMS
	Uhable to compile any of the IMS stuff due to mising annotations h file referenced by sal.h
	I found that the Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\Include folder is missing all kinds of .h files
	(vurses the clean install I did of it on a new computer for this project).  Perhaps they got
	put in another folder.  I found that the path was cross linked with MSDEV9 which could
	cause the wrong tools to be executed and the wrong files to be included in a build.

	I created (via wizard) a Win32 Console Project and it failed to compile due to inability to locate
	stdio.h!

	We shold set this system up so that none of the compilers and such are on the default path
	and that it is explicitly set up for each project by bat file on start if we are going to have
	multiple compilers on this sytem.

DISREGARD THE REST
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The repository server is hard coded at IP 192.168.1.64
It has the WINS name "Desktop"
I am using the IP address here.

URL : svn+jetec://Admin@192.168.1.64/cygdrive/c/IMS5000.repo/svn/trunk

jetec is defined in your svn config file  under [tunnels] as
jetec = \\cygwin\\bin\\ssh -p22440

This implies the need for cygwin to be installed with ssh.

Icon generation from svg files also uses cygwin

=================================
Note: Once I get outside access to the ssh server via a router pinhole, I will change
the authentication to use a certificate.

That will change the URL of the checkouts (which can be changed no problem)
